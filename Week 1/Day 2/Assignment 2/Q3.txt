3.   Why do we use  ~  and >  symbols in css selectors?'

GENERAL SIBLING SELECTOR(~)
It is implemented for selecting the element that trails the initial or first selector element and shares the same parent as 
the first selector element. The general sibling selector is explicitly implemented for choosing a group of elements 
allocated for the same parent element.

Here is a sample example of how it can be implemented:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

    <head>
        <style>
            div ~ p {
                background-color: whitesmoke;
            }
        </style>
    </head>

    <body>
        <p>Some text here.</p>
        <div>
            <p>Some text here.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Some text here.</p>
        <p>Some text here.</p>
    </body>

</html>


CHILD SELECTOR(>)

It is implemented for selecting that particular element that lies within the immediate child of that specific tag. It is more
precise or exact than the descendant selector since it chooses only the second selector if it has the first selector element
as its parent.

Here is a sample example of how it can be implemented:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

    <head>
        <style>
            div > p {
                background-color: whitesmoke;
            }
        </style>
    </head>

    <body>
        <div>
            <p>This Paragraph is within div.</p>
            <p>This Paragraph is within div.</p>
            <section>
                <p>This Paragraph is within section and section is within div.</p>
            </section>
        </div>
        <p>This Paragraph is not within div.</p>
    </body>

</html>
