1. How to apply style to first letter of the paragraph?
In order to apply style only on the first element, we can use the <span> tag i.e an inline element so that there won't be any
line break in between and we can style the part or one word of the text in the paragraph by choosing the element span in CSS 
file. 
For eg:
  
 HTML FILE

	<p>
        <span>L</span>orem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
  	</p>


CSS FILE

	span{
            font-style:bold;
            font-style:italic;
            color:red;
            background-color: yellow;
            font-size:100px;
        }
