1. Why do you use position property in CSS?
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.The CSS position property defines the 
position of an element in a document. This property works with the left, right, top, bottom and z-index properties to 
determine the final position of an element on a page.

There are five different position values:

a)static
b)relative
c)fixed
d)absolute
e)sticky


2. What is the difference between position property values :  absolute / relative;?
a. Relative : If an element is defined as relative, then the element will always have the position according to the defined 
values of its position like: left, right, top, bottom relative to the normal position, and its movement is in liaise with 
scrolling of the page.
b. Absolute : Although the name is absolute, if an element is defined as absolute, then the element will always have the 
position which is relative with respect to its nearest neighbor element instead of the viewpoint or page. If there is no 
neighbor, it will be positioned relative to the body of the document and its movement is in liaise with scrolling of the 
page.
