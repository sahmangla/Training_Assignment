2. What is web crawler and backlink in SEO?
The web crawler is a computer program or automated script that crawls through the World Wide Web in a 
predefined and methodical manner to collect data. The web crawler tool pulls together details about each page: titles, 
images, keywords, other linked pages, etc. It automatically maps the web to search documents, websites, RSS feeds, and email 
addresses. It then stores and indexes this data.
A backlink is a kind of Internet manipulator. It links one particular site with other external websites which contain links 
to this site. In other words, when you visit external sites they will lead you to that particular site. Backlinks are used 
for SEO purposes to optimize a website in a proper way.
