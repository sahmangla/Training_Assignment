1. What is container class in Bootstrap? When do we use container-fluid class?
Our default .container class is a responsive, fixed-width container, meaning its max-width changes at each breakpoint.
For example, .container-sm is 100% wide to start until the sm breakpoint is reached, where it will scale up with md, lg, xl, 
and xxl.
Use .container-fluid for a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport. 100% width at each breakpoints.


2. What is CDN? What are the advantages of using CDN urls?
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a collection of computers that keep data copies at several network nodes. A well-designed 
and adequately executed CDN increases data access by increasing bandwidth and reducing access latency. Web objects, apps, 
database queries, downloadable data objects, and video streams are all examples of CDN content.

Advantages of Using a CDN:-
a. Increasing the speed with which a website's pages load
b. Lowering the cost of bandwidth
c. Increasing the availability and redundancy of content
d. Increasing the safety of your website
