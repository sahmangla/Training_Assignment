Easily clear floats by adding .clearfix to the parent element. Can also be used as a mixin. Without the clearfix the wrapping 
div would not span around the buttons which would cause a broken layout

2. How to hide the elements using Bootstrap?
Content which should be visually hidden, but remain accessible to assistive technologies such as screen readers, can be 
styled using the .visually-hidden class.

3. What is spinner class? How to create spinners in bootstrap?
Bootstrap “spinners” can be used to show the loading state in your projects. They’re built only with HTML and CSS, meaning 
you don’t need any JavaScript to create them. You will, however, need some custom JavaScript to toggle their visibility. 
Their appearance, alignment, and sizing can be easily customized with our amazing utility classes.

For eg:-
--------
<div class="spinner-border text-primary" role="status">
  <span class="visually-hidden">Loading...</span>
</div>
